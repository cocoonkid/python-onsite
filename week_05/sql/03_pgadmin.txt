Using pgadmin:

- create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"

- create a new table named "users_cars" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)


- create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

- create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

- populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

- Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)

   
 - select all records from users

     SELECT * FROM users
   
 - select all records from cars where car make = "Toyota"

     SELECT * FROM cars WHERE make = 'Toyota'
    

- use a join to select the first name and car model of every user who has bought a car


SELECT first_name, cars.model
FROM users
JOIN users_cars
ON users_cars.user_id = users.id
JOIN cars
ON users_cars.car_id = cars.id
     
    - use a join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car

SELECT *
FROM users
JOIN users_cars
ON users_cars.user_id = users.id
JOIN cars
ON users_cars.car_id = cars.id
WHERE cars.color = 'Red'

   
 - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table

INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Joe', 'Cool') RETURNING id;
INSERT INTO cars (make, model, color, year) VALUES ('BMW', 'X5' , 'Blue', 2018) RETURNING id;
INSERT INTO users_cars (user_id, car_id) VALUES (6,6) RETURNING id;

   
 - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table

   UPDATE cars SET model = 'Caravan' WHERE cars.id=2 RETURNING model;

 - delete one record from the database

DELETE FROM cars where id = 5 RETURNING *
